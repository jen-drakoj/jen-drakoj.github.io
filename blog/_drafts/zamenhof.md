I finished reading [Zamenhof, Creator of Esperanto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8239843-zamenhof-creator-of-esperanto), by Marjorie Boulton.

My plan was to read it in Esperanto, which I ordered via Amazon.
However, the book got lost somewhere in the delivery process.

Fortunately, my local library had a copy of the original English version, which is the one I ended up reading.
After sorting out the missed delivery with Amazon, I got sent another copy of the Esperanto version, which luckily arrived.

I loved reading this book; in hindsight it was good that I first read it in English.

Despite already having a vague idea of the history of Esperanto, I came to appreciate the details in the life and work.

The book also made me appreciate the struggles and successes of the Esperantist movement.
Zamenhof poured his life into it and it shows.
He's perhaps a great example of "_Be the change you want to see in the world._"

Furthermore, he was always did it altruistically.
Always humble, he rejected being deified within the Esperantist movement â€“ something that was very difficult at the time and is certainly true in our current time towards other individuals.
Zamenhof knew that if his ideas were to survive, they had to belong to everyone and yet not someone in particular.

The last few chapters of the book are perhaps the saddest.
But even then, in the closing moments of the book, the author managed to summarize Zamenhof's legacy in a very satisfying and emotional way.

Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof was an exceptional individual.
For me, he's proof of the goodness that is in the world.
In him, I found a new role model.

I'm sad that Esperanto lost some critical momentum due to the circumstances of war.
But I don't think his ideas are dead; it is our work to continue his legacy.

As he used to say: **Let us work and hope**.
