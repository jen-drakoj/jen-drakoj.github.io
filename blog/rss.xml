            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commiting to start a blog can be a bit daunting in terms of maintenance.</p>
<p>I don't want to use third-party services, such as <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Ghost</strong>, <strong>Blogger</strong>, etc.
For the most part, they are quite limited (e.g. support for mathematical equations, ease of use).
Furthermore, you are limited to either go freemium or pay to have access to hosting or features.</p>
<p>While <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>Ghost</strong> can be hosted on personal servers, there's the matter of having to pay for the virtual server.
This was one of the reasons why I chose <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GitHub Pages</strong></a> as the means to host this site.</p>
<p>So, finally, I ended up using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Docusaurus</strong></a> for a several of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses plain text files written using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Markdown</strong></a>.</li>
<li>It generates sites statically, making it lighter than other bloated alternatives, such as <strong>WordPress</strong>.</li>
<li>It provides support for a blog and other types of pages.</li>
<li>It is built in (and support creating content) using <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>React</strong></a>, which I have been interested in experiment with.</li>
<li>It has out of the box support for <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are alternatives that can achieve the same, better.
But, for my needs, <strong>Docusaurus</strong> gets the job done – even if I'm not crazy about its UI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always had difficulties taking notes or writing down my thoughts.
Call it hubris or just plain old laziness.</p>
<p>But, in an attempt to get the hang of it, I decided to start exercising my writing muscle.</p>
<p>I'm still not a 100% sure what the scope will be, though.
I want to share the things that I learn, that I do, and, especially, that bring me happiness.</p>
<p>This blog will help me record snapshots of me at a given time.
Meanwhile, the <a href="https://jen-drakoj.github.io/archives"><strong>Archives</strong></a> are meant for things that are atemporal, such as information about projects I'm working on.</p>
