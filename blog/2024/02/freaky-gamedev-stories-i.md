This is a true story, it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.

Emily was a videogame developer that had just recently joined a small start-up company after having grown tired of working for much bigger companies.

Emily was quite happy, finally free from the shackles of such a monolithic and bureaucratic structure.
And, best of all, Emily was surrounded by talented peers, most of them coming from a similar background as hers.

She was happy. At least until the day she took a trip to the restroom; a day that still haunts her until this very same day.

See, the studio head was having a meeting –right in the middle of the office– with the lead game designer of the project regarding one of the core systems of the game.
They were trying to decide how that system was to be shaped, which basically boiled down to two possible but opposite approaches.
And, of course, they each defended different ones.

Anywho, on her way back and as if the result of providence, Emily passed by during the most crucial moment of the meeting.

The lead game designer, growing weary of the heated discussion, said: "You know, that's why I was hired, to make these kind of decisions!"

To which the studio head replied with a dry: **"If that's why you think I hired you, then you are wrong."**

For Emily, this marked the first time she realized she had started working in a very toxic work environment.

And the lead designer? Why, of course, he resigned one week later.
