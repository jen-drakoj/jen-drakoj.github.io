I finished reading [The Bacta War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing:_The_Bacta_War), the fourth entry in the [Star Wars: X-wing](<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_(novel_series)>) book series and final entry in the **Rogue Squadron** tetralogy (the rest of the series focuses in **Wraith Squadron** instead).

I had a blast reading the [_Thrawn_ trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy).
Despite not being perfect, they read like a plausible continuation to the original trilogy of movies.
The characters were overall well written and the main villain felt threatening and interesting.

The _Rogue Squadron_ books, on the other hand, felt more like a chore to read and were cringey quite often.

I grew fond of most of the main characters over the books, which was a bit of a relief.
[Corran Horn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corran_Horn/Legends) in particular, started as an unlikeable character but got better starting the second book.

The villains, however, were a huge disappointment.
Several chunks of the books (to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the book) are spent from their point of view and fail miserably in every possible aspect.

The writing was also a lackluster.
Characters don't speak like normal people, refer multiple times to known characters by full name.
I stopped counting the times wherever characters would say things that were clearly written to be analogues to sayings used in the real world – surprisingly enough, most of them referred to Hutts.

I was really excited to read these books because I grew up with [the Rogue Squadron videogames](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron_(series)>) and I love _Star Wars_ ships.
I was even more excited coming into the books, having seen a famous fan-made video that was released 2 years ago:

Now, not everything was bad.
For once, it was interesting exploring the _Star Wars_ universe with characters other than the main trio.
As I said, I grew fond of Corran and I'm interested in continuing his adventures once I start reading [I, Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/I,_Jedi).

There also quite a few exchanges of dialogue that caught my attention, such as:

> Pacifism for the sake of pacifism is the height of arrogant selfishness when that belief prevents you from acting to save others from harm.

If I had to pick, I'd say that my favorite book was [Wedge's Gamble](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing:_Wedge%27s_Gamble):

- In the first book, [Rogue Squadron](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing:_Rogue_Squadron), the characters were not as likeable and the stakes were not really high.
- The third entry, [The Krytos Trap](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing:_The_Krytos_Trap), focused too much in trials and lawyering, and featured a very underwhelming escape from what should probably be the most secured place in the galaxy.
- The fourth entry, _The Bacta War_, failed to conclude the story in a satisfactory manner.
  Nothing interesting happens and most character development had already happened in previous books.

All in all, these are average books that I'd probably would have either skipped or stopped reading, if they weren't related to _Star Wars_.
