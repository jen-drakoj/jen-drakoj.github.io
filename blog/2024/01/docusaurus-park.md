Committing to start a blog can be a bit daunting for several reasons.
One of them being where should that blog live in.

I don't want to use third-party services, such as **WordPress**, **Medium**, **Ghost**, **Blogger**, etc.
For the most part, they are quite limited (e.g. support for mathematical equations, ease of use).
Furthermore, you must choose to either go freemium or pay in order to have access to hosting or features.

While **WordPress** and **Ghost** can be hosted on personal servers, there's the matter of having to pay for the virtual server.
This was one of the reasons why I chose [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) for this site.

With that matter settled, now I had to decide what platform to use to actually blog.
I ended up picking [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/) for a several of reasons:

- It uses plain text files written in [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- It generates sites statically, making it lighter than other bloated alternatives, such as **WordPress**.
- It provides support for a blog and other types of pages.
- It is built in (and support creating content) using [**React**](https://react.dev/), which I have been interested in experimenting with.
- It has out-of-the-box support for **GitHub Pages**.

I'm sure there are alternatives that can achieve the same, better.
But, for my needs, **Docusaurus** gets the job done â€“ even if I'm not crazy about its UI yet.
