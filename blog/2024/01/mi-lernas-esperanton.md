A few years ago, I learned about the existence of [constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) or _conlangs_, for short.
Shortly after, I discovered [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), arguably the most popular and used _conlang_ in the world.

This is my second attempt at trying to learn the language, after I got sidetracked.

<!-- truncate -->

So far, I have found the language very easy to come back to; Esperanto delivers on the promise of being very easy to learn.

I'm currently using two tools as part of my learning process: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and [Lernu!](https://lernu.net/).

Out of the two, **Lernu!** is probably the tool I'd recommend the most to anyone trying to learn the language.
It can be a bit though to get into (it doesn't have the Pavlovian conditioning of Duolingo), but it actually teaches you the rules of the language.

**Duolingo**, on the other hand, is an OK tool to practice but not to learn.
It also lacks any kind of theoretical material (usually present at the beginning of each unit) and the (audio) quality of the audio exercises is uneven and almost amateurish.

As such, I learn with Lernu! but practice with Duolingo.

## Practicing Esperanto

### Reading

I still haven't commit yet to reading long texts in Esperanto on my own; I have been limiting myself to the exercises provided by the tools I just mentioned.

However, it is within my plans to read [Zamenhof, Autoro de Esperanto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36951498-zamenhof-autoro-de-esperanto), originally written in English but also available in Esperanto.
The book recounts the life of Ludovic Zamenhof, the creator of the language.

### Listening

Aside from speaking, this is something I'm not much of either.
However, I recently discovered (although I shouldn't be surprised) that there's actual music made in Esperanto.

I try to hear it often while working, at least to get used to the way the language sounds.
Not every song is a winner but, considering how niche the market is for Esperanto music, the surprise comes from from finding great tracks.

### Writing

One of the reasons why I decided to start writing more was to also practice my Esperanto.
In the future, I wish to be able to write quality material to help nurture the language in my own way.

In the meantime, I'm experimenting with using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to simulate having someone I can dialogue with and who can correct me.
So far, the experience hasn't been perfect (I've been only using version 3.5), but it is a great starting point.
My approach is to have the AI open up with a question, which I would then answer to, and then provide me feedback on my answer and continue with either a follow-up question or a new topic (if relevant).
This approach allows me to have a coherent conversation, instead of just answering a bunch of unrelated questions.

Now, there's one thing I need to mention about practice writing Esperanto in a digital medium.

The language contains a handful of special, non-ASCII characters: `ĉ`, `ĝ`, `ĥ`, `ĵ`, `ŝ` and `ŭ`; some of them unique to the language even.
This means that most keyboard layouts (especially the standard English ones) won't suffice.

On Android this posed no problem, I only had to install the Esperanto module for my keyboard of choice, [Swiftkey](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey) — ten out of ten, would recommend.

Windows, on the other hand, is a whole different beast.
It either requires jumping through hoops, just to add support as if you were trying to write in other mainstream languages, such as French.

The international English keyboard can be used to input some non-ASCII characters, such as `á`, `å` and `ã`, but it is useless for Esperanto.
The easiest solution I have found so far is using [Microsoft's PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD), which includes a bunch of nifty tools, including one called **Quick Accent**.
This tool provides an ok-ish way to type accented characters; it isn't perfect (at least not as perfect as using `AltGr + <key>` on the keyboard), but it is better than the hacks I found online.

From what I have been able to read so far, the experience is less cumbersome for other OSes, such as GNU/Linux.
