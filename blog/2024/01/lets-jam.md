I have always had difficulties taking notes or writing down my thoughts.
Call it hubris or just plain old laziness.

But, in an attempt to get the hang of it, I decided to start exercising my writing muscle.

I'm still not a 100% sure what the scope will be, though.
I want to share the things that I learn, that I do, and, especially, that bring me happiness.

This blog will help me record snapshots of me at a given time.
Meanwhile, the [**Archives**](/archives) are meant for things that are atemporal, such as information about projects I'm working on.
