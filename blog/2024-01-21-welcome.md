Commiting to start a blog can be a bit daunting in terms of maintenance.

I don't want to use third-party services, such as **WordPress**, **Medium**, **Ghost**, **Blogger**, etc.
For the most part, they are quite limited (e.g. support for mathematical equations, ease of use).
Furthermore, you are limited to either go freemium or pay to have access to hosting or features.

While **WordPress** and **Ghost** can be hosted on personal servers, there's the matter of having to pay for the virtual server.
This was one of the reasons why I chose [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) as the means to host this site.

So, finally, I ended up using [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/) for a several of reasons:

- It uses plain text files written using [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- It generates sites statically, making it lighter than other bloated alternatives, such as **WordPress**.
- It provides support for a blog and other types of pages.
- It is built in (and support creating content) using [**React**](https://react.dev/), which I have been interested in experiment with.
- It has out of the box support for **GitHub Pages**.

I'm sure there are alternatives that can achieve the same, better.
But, for my needs, **Docusaurus** gets the job done â€“ even if I'm not crazy about its UI.
