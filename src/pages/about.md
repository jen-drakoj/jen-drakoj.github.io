# About

Hello there! The name is _Jen_.

I'm a videogame programmer by trade and this is my humble spot on the Internet, where I can collect my thoughts and share them with the world.

My hobbies include games, photography, and reading.

Will this be a great adventure? _The bones tell me... nothing_.
