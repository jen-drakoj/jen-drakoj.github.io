## Working on

In my spare time, I'm currently working on giving shape to this space, my [imaginarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginarium).

## Learning

Last year I began studying languages.

I started with Japanese but, as of lately, I have been falling off the wagon.

I also (re)started learning [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) and I'm glad to report that I have been diligently doing so each and every day ever since.

I'm also learning to play [padel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padel).
It's been quite fun so far!

## Consuming

I recently started watching anime and reading manga again and I'm having a blast with [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen), [Chainsaw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man), and [My Hero Academia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia).

I'm also reading [Zamenhof, Creator of Esperanto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8239843-zamenhof-creator-of-esperanto).
