each interpretation transforms them (for better or worse) in what has now become a long [game of telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).\\nThe myths as we know them are not the same as they used to be a thousand years ago.\\n\\nArmed with this framework, I am enabled to consume things that used to be canon in Star Wars (the Expanded Universe) and things that are the current canon (Sequel Trilogy, et al.), and decide what fits my own vision of what the story is.\\n\\nDisney is the curator/loremaster of their own interpretation.\\nBut we, as fans, are now empowered to embrace or disregard the different interpretations, as a whole or only specific elements of them.\\nOur own headcanon is just interpretation of the Star Wars story: one filled with the things that we like.\\n\\nWith this mindset, there\'s no more such a thing as an singular official canon or even the possibility of parallel worlds.\\nIt is not possible to jump from one to another, because each interpretation exists on its own.\\n\\nOne (unknown) original story, but an infinite number of interpretations."},{"id":"docusaurus-park","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/docusaurus-park","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-21-docusaurus-park.md","title":"Welcome to Docusaurus Park","description":"Commiting to start a blog can be a bit daunting for several reasons.","date":"2024-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 21, 2024","tags":[{"label":"site","permalink":"/blog/tags/site"}],"readingTime":1.185,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jen Drakoj","title":"Amateur Dragoneer","url":"https://github.com/jen-drakoj","imageURL":"https://github.com/jen-drakoj.png","key":"jen"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"docusaurus-park","title":"Welcome to Docusaurus Park","authors":["jen"],"tags":["site"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A fantastical alternative to the Multiverse","permalink":"/blog/fantasic-multiverse"},"nextItem":{"title":"Okay, 3, 2, 1.
